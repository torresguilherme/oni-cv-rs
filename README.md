A computer vision library made with pure Rust

This is being made as an educational project and is currently **very** incomplete. And I have no deadlines or a prediction of when I'll finish this. Please keep that in mind before attempting to use this software.

I do not intend to support this yet, and I won't be accepting direct contributions *for now*, at least until I set up some guidelines for contributing. If you're interested in this project, just leave a motivational star, that will surely make me want to improve this faster. If you have suggestions or ideas, please open an issue and I might consider or not your advice.

Nothing in this library (yet) is novel, this is just an implementation of computer vision algorithms that are already established.

The goals are:

- Building a computer vision library, inspired by [Richard Szeliski's book](http://szeliski.org/Book/) that one can for the the classic computer vision algorithms that are addressed there.

- Building a completely modular, fast, idiomatic, safe and tested library, with few dependencies (although there are some dependencies, they're all pure Rust).

- Eventually being able to offer a product that can be maintained by a community.
